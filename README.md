# Modal easySam

The library is designed to be used with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

It provides modal components that display information in a floating modal window on the screen. Modals are often used to display additional details, data entry forms or alert messages.

The library is published on npm, which is an online repository for JavaScript packages (sets of files). This means that you can install and use it in your project using npm or another dependency management tool, such as yarn.

To use the library, you can import the modal components into your code and use them like any other React component. You can customize the appearance and behavior of modals by passing properties to these components.

The library can be updated regularly to add new features and fix bugs. You can check for available updates on npm or on the library's GitHub page.

## Getting Started

Install this package:

```shell
npm install modal-easysam || yarn add modal-easysam
```

Import the Modal component:

```js
import { Modal } from "modal-easysam";
```

You can then render the `Modal` component like any other React component in JSX.
